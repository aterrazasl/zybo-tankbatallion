# zybo-tankbatallion

This project is a port from verilog to VHDL from this link https://github.com/nic24-rgb/TankBatt
More information in youtube link https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyyulMfhskfuqLiyJw3GMSg

This project uses Zybo board from Digilent

To generate the Vivado project, run the build.bat script

if just need to upload the bitfile, use the file in the bitfile folder

Next steps...
The Zybo board has some buttons but not enough to play the game in a confortable manner.
next to include a game controller to interface with the FPGA side
